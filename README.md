## 🚀 Why CarbonWise

Most people *want* to help the planet — but climate data is intimidating, abstract, and easy to ignore. **CarbonWise turns climate into a personal, gamified, AI-guided journey.** Every kilogram of CO₂ is translated into something you can feel ("equals 3,567 km driven", "20 trees absorbing for a year"), and a real AI coach tells you exactly what to change *this week*.

It's not a calculator. It's a coach in your pocket.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

- **Framework:** TanStack Start v1 (React 19 + Vite 7, file-based routing, SSR + server functions)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 + a custom **Midnight Aurora** design system (semantic tokens in `src/styles.css`, no hardcoded colors)
- **UI:** shadcn/ui + Lucide icons + Recharts + Sonner toasts
- **Backend:** Lovable Cloud (Postgres + Auth + RLS)
- **AI:** Lovable AI Gateway → `google/gemini-2.5-flash` (streaming chat + multimodal vision)
- **State:** TanStack Query + custom `use-profile` hooks
- **Validation:** Zod on every server-function input/output
- **Deployment:** Cloudflare Workers (edge)

### Architecture highlights

- **Server functions** (`createServerFn`) for chat streaming and bill analysis — no exposed API keys, full RLS-aware DB access.
- **Auth gate** in the `_app` layout — every protected route redirects to `/auth` if no session.
- **Row-Level Security** on `profiles`, `habit_logs`, `scanned_bills` — users can only ever see/touch their own data.
- **Auto-profile creation** via a `SECURITY DEFINER` Postgres trigger on `auth.users`.
- **Password reset flow** via `/forgot-password` + `/reset-password` listening to `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` events.
- **SEO-ready:** unique `<head>` per route, sitemap.xml route, llms.txt, semantic HTML.

## 🗄️ Database schema

```
profiles         (id, display_name, avatar_url, country, weekly_co2_goal_kg, onboarding jsonb)
habit_logs       (id, user_id, habit_id, co2_saved_kg, xp, log_date)
scanned_bills    (id, user_id, type, vendor, estimate_kg, insight, mime_type)
```

Every table has RLS enabled with `auth.uid() = user_id` policies and explicit `GRANT`s to `authenticated`.

---

## 🏃 Run locally

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173`. Lovable Cloud injects all required env vars automatically — no `.env` setup needed.

## 🎮 Try it yourself

1. Open the deployed app
2. Create an account (any email / password)
3. Walk through onboarding (~30 sec)
4. Land on the dashboard — your sustainability score is live
5. Open **AI Coach** → ask *"Give me 3 realistic changes I can make this week."*

## 🏆 Why this should win

- **Real AI, not a wrapper** — streaming chat, multimodal vision, Zod-validated structured outputs.
- **Real persistence** — every habit, scan, and profile change lives in Postgres with RLS.
- **Real polish** — bespoke Midnight Aurora design system, motion, semantic tokens, accessibility-aware.
- **Real impact framing** — kilograms translated into trees, kilometres, phone charges — climate that *feels* personal.
- **Production-grade architecture** — TanStack Start server functions, edge-deployed, typed end-to-end.

Built with 💚 for a greener tomorrow.
